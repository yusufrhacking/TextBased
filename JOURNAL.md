I am trying something new. This might make me more active on here; if I just show up to write down my thoughts like this.

Right now, I think jumping into the literature right away is a bad idea. I am sort of lost. 
I don't know how I am supposed to play around with these books. I should start with the philosophy.

This is precisely what I am doing with the readings already.
So, the first thing I should do is create philosophical things to do.

We begin with the Tractatus! I have zeal now, we will see how it lasts.
I think I should make it so that you are climbing up the world; it is like those jumping games with platforms

When you get to the top, you get a **ladder**

The platforms you climb up are the various sub-points from the Tractatus

You will have to fight the forces of nonsense as you go through.

You will build propositions as you climb the tower. Does this mean I have to use basic objects?
Wittgenstein doesn't really use examples in it, but I suppose I will. It has to be a game after all.

I will


- Make a vertical camera
+ I already know how to do platforms, jumping, and gravity
+ Player will be named Wittgenstein

Perhaps, when you climb the ladder in the level, something about how language functions changes.
Like Baba is You, almost. I am not sure.
