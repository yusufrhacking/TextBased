## Tractatus Opener
Starts on the very first point, the 1.0
It serves as the foundation, obviously

Color-code the tiers of thought? I could do it with size, but that is stag

- Make foundational 1.0 point
- Make a vertical camera
- Make the basic sub-points (you have to hit all of these before you get to the next one, obviously)

Perhaps I can line the walls so that it looks like a ladder? Maybe it says Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus around the walls
We are messing around on the rungs

- Try to surround the frame with Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus

When you get to the top, you get a ladder. You use the ladder throughout the game!!

## Philosophical Investigations
Use the ladder in some way; but the ladder doesn't quite work, either, right? 
No, the ladder does work. My point is Wittgenstein is wrong.
